These GUI models where created by using the Qt Bridge plugin for Figma.
<br/>I will provide here the link to the plugin and how to intsall and use it. https://doc.qt.io/qtdesignstudio/qtbridge-figma-setup.html
These models can be viewed in the UI Design tool QT Design Studio. 
There will be future modifications to these models later along the line.
