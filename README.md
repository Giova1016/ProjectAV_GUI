<h1> Basics of the GUI models </h1>
<h2> These GUI models where created by using the Qt Bridge plugin for Figma. </h2>
<h3> I will provide here the link to the plugin and how to install and use it. 
 <br/>- Link to the plugin: https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1167809465162924409
 <br/>- Link to instructions on how to install and use it: https://doc.qt.io/qtdesignstudio/qtbridge-figma-setup.html
 </h3>
<br/>- These models can be viewed in the UI Design tool QT Design Studio. 
<br/>- There will be future modifications to these models later along the line.
<br/>- The updated version now has a Python implementation to render the .qml files.
<br/>- After you git clone this repo you can run pip install -r requirements.txt to download the necessary requirements to run the main.py
