<h1> Basics of the GUI models <h1/>
<h2> These GUI models where created by using the Qt Bridge plugin for Figma. </h2>
<br/>I will provide here the link to the plugin and how to intsall and use it. https://doc.qt.io/qtdesignstudio/qtbridge-figma-setup.html
<br/>These models can be viewed in the UI Design tool QT Design Studio. 
<br/>There will be future modifications to these models later along the line.
